Current flow in a circuit, is measured in amperes, or, amps, for short.
The amount of current flow in a circuit, is determined by the amount of the supply voltage, or pushing force of the electrons; and how much the circuit retards the flow of electrons.

For example, if the supply voltage were to be doubled, the amount of current flow in the circuit, would also be doubled; because there is more "pushing force", to make more free electrons move.

Likewise, if the voltage supply were to be halved, the amount of current flow in the circuit, would also be halved; because there is less "pushing force", to move the electrons.

If the voltage remained the same, but the resistance of the circuit were to be doubled, the amount of current flow in the circuit, would be cut in half; because it is twice as hard to move the electrons with the added resistance.

Note the purple color of the electrons between the two lights.
The reason for this, is because "that" wire is no longer at a positive potential, nor is it at a negative potential.
It is somewhere in between the two. We will discuss this in more detail in a later section.

The current flow in the circuit would be doubled.
Because the parallel circuit, has created less resistance to the electron flow, by providing another path for electrons to go down.

Note that the electron Flo splits Here: Half of the electrons will flow through the lower light circuit, and half will flow through the upper light circuit.
The electrons come back together here: to form one path of flow back to the positive side of the baddery.

Slide 6 -----------------------------------------------------------------

The electrical resistance of an object, is a measure of its opposition to the flow of current in a circuit. 
The amount of resistance an object has, is given in ohms, and is represented by the omega symbol.
One ohm, is the amount of resistance required, to limit current flow, to one amp of current, when the applied voltage is one volt.

The number of free electrons in the resistor, is what determines the amount of current flow.
In this case, there are enough free electrons in the resistor to allow one amp of current flow.
When the resistor resistance is changed to 2 ohms, the number of free electrons is cut in half, which in turn, cuts the circuit current in half.

Even though there are plenty of free electrons in the wires;  the current of the entire circuit, will still be limited by the number of free electrons in the resistance of the circuit.
The resistance of the circuit is more or less, the throttle for current flow.
The hight the circuit resistance is, the lower the current flow will be in the circuit.
And con versely, the lower the circuit resistance is, the higher the current flow will be in the circuit.

Also note, if parallel resistance is added to the circuit, the resistance of the entire circuit will decrease.
The added parallel resistance, provides an alternate path, that offers more free electrons to the entire circuit.

The higher the circuit resistance is, the lower the current flow will be in the circuit.
And con versely, the lower the circuit resistance is, the higher the current flow will be in the circuit.

Slide7
The circuit shown here is called a series circuit.
All of the components are in line with one another.

The characteristics of a series circuit are:
1) Current flow is the same, in all parts of the circuit.
2) Added resistance, decreases current flow.
3) The sum of the voltage drops of the circuit, is equal to the supply voltage.
